[!["Buy Me A Coffee"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/itchannel)

## Install
Use HACS and add as a custom repo. Once the integration is installed go to your integrations and follow the configuration options below:
- Tdarr Server IP
- Tdarr Port (Prefilled to Tdarr default port 8265)

## Currently Supported
- Server status
- Node information
- Node FPS
- Switches to pause/unpause a node


This is a custom integration I have created to allow me to use HA to control my nodes such as pausing/unpausing transcoding depending on how much excess solar electricity I have.
